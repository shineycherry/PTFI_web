            <h2>Introduction to Homomorphic Encryption (HE)</h2>
            <img src="homo.jpeg" alt="PTFI Logo" class="logo">
            <p>Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is a form of encryption that allows computations to be performed on encrypted
                data without the need to decrypt it first. This means sensitive data can be processed while remaining
                encrypted, ensuring privacy and security throughout the computation process. This feature makes HE
                particularly valuable in financial services, healthcare, and other industries where data privacy is
                critical.</p>

            <h3>How Homomorphic Encryption Works</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Data Encryption:</strong> Data is first encrypted using a public key, converting it into an
                    encrypted format that is unreadable to anyone without the corresponding private key.</li>
                <li><strong>Performing Operations on Encrypted Data:</strong> Once the data is encrypted, computations
                    can be performed on this data without decrypting it. This means sensitive data can remain private
                    even during processing.</li>
                <li><strong>Decryption of Results:</strong> After the computations are complete, the encrypted result
                    can be sent back to the data owner. The data owner uses their private key to decrypt the result,
                    revealing the final computed outcome.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Benefits of Homomorphic Encryption in Financial Services</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Privacy:</strong> Since data remains encrypted during computations, sensitive
                    information is never exposed, ensuring high levels of privacy.</li>
                <li><strong>Secure Data Sharing:</strong> Organizations can share data for processing without risking
                    unauthorized access, as the data remains encrypted.</li>
                <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> HE helps meet strict privacy regulations, such as GDPR, by
                    ensuring that personal data is always protected.</li>
                <li><strong>Fraud Detection and Risk Management:</strong> Financial institutions can analyze encrypted
                    data to detect fraud or assess risks without exposing sensitive customer information.</li>
            </ul>
